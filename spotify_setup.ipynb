      "    WikiContent: The track had its world exclusive first play during an interview with Zane Lowe on Beats One on November 26, 2015. The heartfelt ballad is from Coldplay’s 2015 album “A Head Full of Dreams” and features vocals from Chris Martin’s ex-wife, Gwyneth Paltrow. During the interview with Zane Lowe, lead singer, Chris Martin, explained how he met a surfer on the beach who was exclaimed to Martin, “Yo dude, I was doing this thing the other day, man. It gave me this total everglow” and Martin liked the word. Martin explained that the song was about “ whether it’s a loved one or a situation or a friend or a relationship that’s finished, or someone’s passed away, after you’ve been through the sadness of something, you also get this everglow”. Martin said that for him, the track Everglow was inspired by the break-up with his ex-wife Gwyneth Paltrow.  <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Coldplay/_/Everglow\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

      "    WikiContent: \"Yellow\" is a song by English alternative rock band Coldplay. The band wrote the song and co-produced it with British record producer Ken Nelson for their debut album, Parachutes. The song's lyrics are a reference to band vocalist Chris Martin's unrequited love, and its musicscape is built on a varied instrumentation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The song was released in June 2000 as the second single off the album, following \"Shiver\", and the lead single in the United States. The single reached number four in the UK Singles Chart, giving the band their first top-five hit in the United Kingdom.\n",
      "\n",
      "Helped by heavy rotation and usage in promotions, the song thrust the band into massive popularity. \"Yellow\" has since been covered by various recording artists worldwide, and remains one of the band's most popular songs.\n",
      "\n",
      "While composing the song's lyrics, however, Chris Martin could not find the right words. He was thinking of a specific word, which he deemed a missing key word in the lyrics, to fit the song's concept. He looked around the studio and found the telephone directory Yellow Pages, which happened to be situated nearest to him. Chris Martin later titled the song \"Yellow\" as a reference to the directory. But according to him, \"In an alternate universe, this song could be called 'Playboy.'\" The lyrics progressed from there with the band collaborating. The band's bassist Guy Berryman came up with the opening line \"Look at the stars\". That night, having quickly composed the song, the band recorded it.\n",

In an interview with Rolling Stone, Martin revealed that while working on the band's second album, A Rush of Blood to the Head, he knew that the album was missing something. One night, during a stay in Liverpool, Martin found an old piano that was out of tune. He wanted to work on George Harrison's song \"Isn't It a Pity\", but he could not manage to do so. When the song came to Martin, he asked that the recorder be turned on. He concludes with saying that he came across this chord sequence and noted that the chord was \"lovely\". Martin recorded the vocals and piano takes in a studio in Liverpool.\n",

      "    WikiContent: \"A Sky Full of Stars\" is a song by the British rock band Coldplay. It was released in May 2014 as the second single from their sixth album, Ghost Stories (2014). An exclusive digital EP version of it, with the B-sides \"All Your Friends\", \"Ghost Story\" and \"O (Reprise)\", came out in the following weeks, being considered the band's eleventh extended play.\n",
      "\n",
      "The band co-wrote and co-produced the song with Swedish DJ Avicii and received production assistance from Paul Epworth, Daniel Green and Rik Simpson. It was recorded at the Bakery and the Beehive in North London, England. Upon its release, \"A Sky Full of Stars\" garnered mostly positive reviews from music critics and charted inside the top 10 in over 16 countries such as Australia, Canada, Ireland, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and United States.\n",
      "\n",
      "A music video for the song was directed by Mat Whitecross and was released on 19 June 2014. The single peaked at number one in Italy, Israel, Luxembourg, Portugal, Lebanon, and the Walloon region of Belgium. It also topped the Billboard Hot Dance Club Songs chart. It was nominated for Best Pop Duo/Group Performance at the 57th Grammy Awards.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A Sky Full of Stars\" was recorded during the sessions for the band's sixth studio album, at their purpose-built studios the Bakery and the Beehive in North London, England. The studios were both originally constructed for work on their two previous studio albums, 2008's Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends and 2011's Mylo Xyloto.\n",
      "\n",
      "Avicii was invited by the band to collaborate on \"A Sky Full of Stars\". In addition to producing the track, he was also asked by lead singer Chris Martin to play and record the piano parts. However, Martin later stated in a BBC Radio 1 interview with Zane Lowe that he felt that he had \"cheated\" on the band by asking Avicii to play the piano instead of playing it himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "The single art for \"A Sky Full of Stars\" was etched by UK-based, Czech etching artist Mila Fürstová. The artwork continues the motif of artworks in the Ghost Stories album cycle, which feature a scene occurring in a larger, enclosed body. Multiple figures such as angels with wings like of the Ghost Stories artwork, buildings such as a church, and objects such as a maze and a chair, also alluding to those in the Ghost Stories artwork, are depicted encased in a three-dimensional star chart. The artwork is reminiscent of Fürstová's earlier work, Other Skies, which also features various figures, buildings and objects imposed onto a star map.\n",
      "\n",
      "The official music video was directed by Mat Whitecross and the shooting took place on King Street, Newtown, Sydney, on 17 June 2014. It was released on 19 June 2014. At the beginning of the video, Martin walks down King Street dressed as a one-man band, singing the first verse of the song. Then he reaches the other members of the band (also dressed as one-man bands) and, together, they play the instrumental refrain. Martin is then seen walking through the street, without the other members, while he sings the second verse. At the end of the video the band reunites in a square, singing and playing the final part of the song with a crowd of fans. While Martin is singing the final part, many paper-made stars are blown into the square.\n",
      "\n",
      "An alternate music video, produced by design studio Artisan, shows the band performing the song in a dark room where an animation of stars is projected onto the floor. The musicians interact with the projection and the stars swirl and fly around following their movements. During an interview, Martin revealed this version was actually the original idea for the music video, but was later scrapped and they decided to shoot a new video in Sydney. However, snippets from the Artisan video were included in the official one and they can be seen playing on the TV screens in a shop's showcase.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the Apple 2014 Event held on September 9 of that year, \"A Sky Full of Stars\" was the song of choice when the first introduction video unveiled the Apple Watch. At the 2019 AFC Asian Cup , this song is played after the national anthem of two teams in every matches. \"A Sky Full of Stars\" was played during the 2020 Democratic National Convention and after the acceptance speeches of U.S. President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris following their victory in the 2020 presidential election on November 7, 2020. Dana Bash of CNN noted the significance of the song choice for Biden as it was the favourite song of his late son Beau Biden. \n",
      "\n",
      "The song was also played during the 3-Point Shootout of the 2015 NBA All-Star Game weekend. It was also chosen by the players of English football team Liverpool F.C. to play during the celebrations as they lifted the 2019–20 Premier League, their first league title in 30 years. Taron Egerton performed the song as his character Johnny for the 2021 animated film Sing 2; the song was also included on the film's soundtrack. On Paulo Dybala's presentation day at his new club AS Roma in 2022, the song was played in front of massive crowd of Roma fans;[42] it was also previously played during the post-match celebration of Juventus F.C. after their game against S.S. Lazio – Dybala's final match with the club. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Coldplay/_/A+Sky+Full+of+Stars\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

      "    WikiContent: \"Hymn for the Weekend\" is a song by British rock band Coldplay featuring uncredited vocals from American singer Beyoncé. It was released on 25 January 2016 as the second single from their seventh studio album, A Head Full of Dreams (2015), where it appears as the third track.\n",

      "Background\n",
      "\n",
      "The song was debuted on Annie Mac's BBC radio show on 30 November 2015, and Coldplay bassist Guy Berryman dialed in after the song aired to talk about his brush with royalty. According to Berryman, lead singer Chris Martin originally wanted the song to be a party song with lyrics like \"drinks on me, drinks on me\", but his bandmates didn't think that would go well with their fans. Beyoncé, who was Martin's longtime friend, was asked to sing on the song, and she accepted the request.\n",
      "\n",
      "Martin corroborated Berryman's story about the band protesting him singing, \"Drinks on me, drinks on me\" in an interview with The Wall Street Journal. According to Martin, the original kernel was that he was listening to Flo Rida or something, and he thought, it's such a shame that Coldplay could never have one of those late-night club songs, like \"Turn Down for What\". \"I thought I’d like to have a song called 'Drinks on Me' where you sit on the side of a club and buy everyone drinks because you're so fucking cool,\" Martin recalled. \"I was chuckling about that, when this melody came, 'drinks on me, drinks on me', then the rest of the song came out. I presented it to the rest of the band and they said, 'We love this song, but there's no way you can sing \"drinks on me.\"' So that changed into 'drink from me' and the idea of having an angelic person in your life. Then that turned into asking Beyoncé to sing on it.\"\n",

      "Music video\n",

      "According to The Times of India, the video was shot in October, in Mumbai, India. The video was filmed by Ben Mor, and was released on 29 January 2016.[3][4] The video features Beyoncé and Indian actress Sonam Kapoor.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I love Coldplay's music and so does the world. It was a huge honour to be a part of the video. It's a great concept and I had a lot of fun shooting for it.\" Kapoor said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The video captures several snippets of Indian life including sadhus in bright saffron robs, children splashing holi colors in India's busy streets and back flipping into streams, puppeteers on streets, classical dancers, marigold flowers, fireworks and fire-breathers. Within hours, the video came under severe criticism, especially from social media users who claimed that the video showed Indian stereotypes and attempted cultural appropriation by showing Beyonce as a bollywood actress in traditional Indian dress. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Coldplay/_/Hymn+for+the+Weekend\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It is the eighth track on the album and was released on 6 July 2022 through Parlophone and Atlantic Records as the album's fourth single, accompanied by an official music video.

      "\n",
      "Background and recording\n",
      "\n",
      "The initial stages of \"Biutyful\" were developed at the beginning of the recording sessions for Coldplay's eighth studio album, Everyday Life, and was considered a strong contender for inclusion on the album for a long time. According to Phil Harvey during a broadcast on Stationhead, Chris Martin wrote the song using an app on his phone that modulates his voice, giving him the vocal effect heard in the final product; this exact vocal sound was used since the very first demo recording of the song. Although Chris was determined to include it on Everyday Life, the song was ultimately saved for Music of the Spheres.\n",
      "\n",
      "Composition and concept\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Biutyful\" was described as a “shyly blissed-out” song and a “mellow, love-dazed ballad with computer processed vocals about a saccharine state of happiness.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Guy Berryman stated the processed, high-pitched vocals were produced in a way to change Chris' vocal identity to sound like it is an alien singing the song. Conceptually, \"Biutyful\" is mainly performed by the fictional alien puppet band The Weirdos with Coldplay performing as a featured artist. The female high-pitched voice is done by The Weirdos' lead singer Angel Moon, drawing parallels with the Everyday Life track \"Cry Cry Cry\", which also features Angel Moon's (formerly \"Angelina\") vocals. Regarding the unusual spelling of the song's title, Angel Moon explained that it is how the word \"Beautiful\" is spelt on the planet where The Weirdos come from; she also mentioned the song is about “how there is beauty and magic in all things and all people.” <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Coldplay/_/Biutyful\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

They settled on \"Don't Panic\", which at the time was an audience favorite. The single was released in some European regions, and the United Kingdom only received a promo edition.

      "    WikiContent: \"Clocks\" emerged in conception during the late stages into the production of Coldplay's second album, A Rush of Blood to the Head. The band's vocalist, Chris Martin, came in studio late one night. A riff popped  up in Martin's mind and wrote it on the  piano. Martin presented the riff to the band's guitarist, Jonny Buckland, who then added guitar chords on the basic track.\n",
      "\n",
      "During the writing of \"Clocks\", the band had already made 10 songs for the album. With this, they thought it was too late for the song's inclusion in the album. So, they recorded a demo version of the track and saved it with other unfinished tracks, labeling it \"Songs for #3\"; the band considered these tracks for their third album, X&Y.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although the band left \"Clocks\" unfinished, a friend of Martin heard of it and convinced him to finish the track. Marked by its lyrics which speak of urgency, Martin's friend pointed out that its meaning would contradict Martin's idea of stashing the track.\n",
      "\n",
      "Persuaded by his friend, Martin assumed on further developing the track. Other band members supplemented their ideas on the main piano track; they added a bass figure and drums. The last song included in the album, Coldplay recorded the song very fast. By the time Martin recorded his vocals, a few people inside the studio felt the song \"is something special\". According to Martin, \"Clocks\" was inspired by the English rock band Muse.\n",

      "\"Clocks\" is a piano rock song. Its musicscape is built around a repeating piano riff, and features a minimalist soundscape of drums and bass. It also includes synthesizers and a sparse string arrangement.\n",
      "\n",
      "The song's lyrical themes include contrast, contradictions and urgency. Chris Martin sings of being in the state of \"helplessness ... in a dysfunctional relationship he doesn't necessarily want to escape\". The lyrics are cryptic; the ending lines of the second verse emphasize contradiction of emotion: \"Come out upon my seas/Cursed missed opportunities/Am I a part of the cure/Or am I part of the disease?\".The song's title also \"metaphorically alludes\" to its lyrics, \"pushing one to wonder about the world’s obsession with time while connecting it to the theory: make the best of it when we’re here, present and alive\".\n",

      "On 30 November 2011, the song was nominated for a Grammy Award, in the category Best Pop Duo/Group Performance. On 12 February 2012, Coldplay performed \"Paradise\" live at the RE, along with \"Princess of China\". At the 2012 MTV Video Music Awards on 6 September, the song won the award for Best Rock Video. Following the 2012 Stanley Cup playoffs on CBC, the song was featured in a yearly finale montage on CBC recapping the Stanley Cup Playoffs as well as British and American television advertisements and trailers for the film Life of Pi, which was nominated for eleven Academy Awards.\n",

      "Coldplay initially announced that the single's music video would be directed by Hype Williams, but that version was scrapped after shooting and the band decided instead to record a new version directed by long-time collaborator Mat Whitecross. The band called Whitecross just a day before the shooting and the video's concept was finished just hours before the director travelled from London to South Africa. Chris Martin created the video's concept storyline, which was ultimately filmed in the style of a nature documentary. Due to a combination of time constraints in shooting the video and Martin's conceptualization, the elephant suits were intendedly \"lo-fi and spontaneous\", and the unicycle had to be found in a hurry. The video was released on YouTube on 18 October 2011.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the video, Chris Martin, dressed as an elephant, escapes from the zoo. He finds an abandoned sharing system bicycle, rides it to Belsize Park London Underground station, and takes the train to Heathrow Airport in an attempt to hitch-hike his way to another country, doing so finally by stowing away inside a suitcase. An aerial shot reveals that his initial destination was Cape Town, South Africa. He is then seen wandering around Johannesburg at one point, walking past Nelson Mandela Bridge and a set of railway tracks in Braamfontein. He then earns enough money, which appears to be ZAR 67.05 (roughly equivalent to GBP 5.34 or US$8.40), by busking on the street, which shows portions of the song's lyrics in sync, to buy a bike; the shopkeeper suggests a unicycle instead. After a seemingly hopeless wander on his new unicycle (in which Martin takes off his elephant head for a second), he comes across three other elephants, who are the rest of Coldplay, playing the song in the veld. Will Champion is dressed as Snorky from the fictional band The Banana Splits, identifiable by his glasses and polka-dot ears. He starts playing with them, and the band eventually play a sell-out stadium concert together, before returning to the veld where they run towards the camera. The video was shot on location in London, Cape Town, the Klein Karoo in the Western Cape and Johannesburg. The zoo that Martin escapes from is Paradise Wildlife Park in Broxbourne, Hertfordshire. The bike shop shown is Woodstock Cycleworks in Woodstock, Cape Town. The concert segment was filmed during Coldplay's Mylo Xyloto Tour concert at the FNB Stadium on 8 October 2011. After performing this song live, the band donned their elephant heads and gloves and pretended to perform as the last minute of the studio recording played. The concertgoers were encouraged to cheer and sing along as if they were actually performing. As of 2023, the video has over 1.796 billion views on YouTube.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another music video was directed by Shynola, who had directed the video for \"Strawberry Swing\". The video was intended as the first incarnation for the video before the band came up with the elephant concept. The promo pictures the life of a little girl that comes out from jail. A special video of \"Paradise\" was created for the 2012 Summer Paralympics and shown between event breaks. This version featured clips of Paralympian Athletes competing in events.\n",
      "\n",
      "The song was met with positive reviews from the majority of music critics. Billboard gave a positive review calling the track \"another slice of hug-warm ecstasy\" and gave praise to the \"boiling strings, rattling synthesizers, and bass-heavy-beats\" saying \"it shows they know how to bring a few new tricks to the table\". Both Q and Rolling Stone offered similar praise, and also noted that it was another step in the right direction. Altsounds.com gave a similar review remarking that there are \"Drums that you would expect in a Rihanna song and melodies you would expect from a band like Friendly Fires and the \"oohs\" from 3OH!3 is what you first hear. That is, of course, until Chris Martin's vocals come into play and there is no doubt in your mind that this is Coldplay. A wonderful chorus of \"para-para-paradise\" reminds you just how good they really are. It will remain with you for weeks to come, like that new piece of clothing you just can't get enough of\". <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Coldplay/_/Paradise\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

      "    WikiContent: \"Let Somebody Go\" is a song by Coldplay from their ninth studio album, Music of the Spheres. It is the fifth track on the album and features American singer and actress Selena Gomez. On the concept of the album, the track represents Calypso, the fourth planet on The Spheres solar system. On March 26, 2021, Chris Martin was invited to host a singing competition on social live audio app Clubhouse. When asked to play something at the end of his interview, Chris briefly performed the first verse of a new song, which were untitled at the time. After the performance, he claimed the song would \"be out sometime.\"[1] In late September 2021, the song was revealed to be actually \"Let Somebody Go\" On September 2, Chris posted on Coldplay's social media a list of songs and artists he was loving at the moment and included on it the 2021 single \"999\" by Selena Gomez featuring Colombian singer Camilo. Gomez started following the band on Instagram soon afterward.[3][4] Fans also claimed they heard Selena's voice on album trailer \"Overtura\" during the snippet of \"Let Somebody Go\", as well as noticing Instagram interactions on Coldplay's Music of the Spheres album posts by Gomez's account, which sparked rumours over an eventual collaboration between both artists. Prior to Coldplay's iHeartRadio album release party for Music of the Spheres on September 14, the band were interviewed on stage. Chris talked about \"My Universe\", their collaboration with South Korean K-pop band BTS, and was asked about other musicians in the music industry that the band would like to work with. He stated that the band has already worked with all the artists they would like and briefly mentioned they have recorded a song with Selena Gomez, not giving any further information about it. On September 29, Coldplay started following Selena back on Instagram. On October 3, Simon Boyle from British tabloid newspaper The Sun reportedly revealed that Coldplay and Selena Gomez would be collaborating on the track, defining it as \"a dream come true that [Selena] is finally singing on a Coldplay record.\"[8] The following day, Selena Gomez confirmed her guest appearance on Music of the Spheres, teasing a preview video of \"Let Somebody Go\" on her Twitter account.[9]\n",
      "About how the band chose to collaborate with Gomez on the track, Chris stated, \"It just felt like she's the perfect person to sing this together. Her voice has this warm rich emotion in it, so the song leads the way.\"[10] <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Coldplay/_/Let+Somebody+Go\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

      "    WikiContent: \"Heartless\" is a song recorded by Canadian singer The Weeknd. It was released on November 27, 2019, through XO and Republic Records, as the lead single from his fourth studio album After Hours. The Weeknd wrote and produced the song alongside Metro Boomin, Illangelo, and Dre Moon. The song combines R&B and trap with elements of electroclash.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Heartless\" received acclaim from critics, praising it for its production, catchiness and the Weeknd's vocals. It peaked at number three on the Canadian Hot 100. Elsewhere, the song topped the US Billboard Hot 100, giving the Weeknd his fourth number-one song on the chart, and also has figured within the record charts in other 28 countries and was the last new number one single of the 2010s. A vaporwave remix of the song featuring American rapper Lil Uzi Vert was released alongside the deluxe edition of its parent album on March 23, 2020. On April 3, 2020, an extended and normal-pitched version of the Lil Uzi Vert remix was released alongside the parent album's accompanying remix EP.\n",

      "The Weeknd first teased that he was working on a new album in November 2018, via a performance in which he told the crowd that \"Chapter VI was coming soon.\" Following a trio of collaborative singles throughout 2019, on August 6, he further reassured fans that he was working on his fourth studio album. Then after a period of silence, on November 24 the single \"Blinding Lights\" was revealed through a Mercedes-Benz television commercial, with reports of \"Heartless\" surfacing a day later, along with its leaked cover art. It then premiered on the seventh episode of The Weeknd's Beats 1 radio show Memento Mori on November 27, 2019. In an interview with CR Men, The Weeknd confirmed that \"Heartless\" was the first song that he wrote for After Hours after the release of his 2018 EP My Dear Melancholy.\n",

However, on the issue dated December 21, 2019, \"Heartless\" fell sixteen places out of the top ten to number 17 partly due to Christmas songs overtaking the upper half of the chart, becoming the biggest drop from the number-one spot in the chart's 61-year history. The song later returned to the top ten (at number four) after the release of After Hours on the issue dated April 4, 2020, its first week in the top ten since December 2019. On April 5, 2022, \"Heartless\" was awarded a 3x Platinum certification from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for selling two million units in the United States.

Max Martin and Oscar Holter received additional production credits. The track also features additional vocals by Jim Carrey, who provides narration throughout the album.

      "\"Out of Time\" was released on January 7, 2022, alongside its parent album. The song has been described by critics as an R&B and city pop ballad with elements of boogie. The song is written in the key of C minor with a tempo of 93 beats per minute. Lyrically, the song details how the Weeknd's trauma from past relationships has negatively affected his ability to fix the romantic relationship he had with his former partner.\n",

In the video, The Weeknd and Jung meet in an empty hotel and quickly bond over singing the song at a karaoke box. They steal the karaoke machine and frolic around the hotel drinking, dancing, and singing the song in shots that pay homage to scenes from Sofia Coppola’s Lost In Translation. Towards the end, however, an older version of Abel tries to reach out to his present self, before the video transitions to the older Abel's point of view in a surgery room, where Jim Carrey, narrating the final lines, puts a mask on him.\n",

      "Based on the song’s lyrics, “Double Fantasy” seems to be a reference to a desire or a fantasy that The Weeknd has, which may not be morally right or socially acceptable. The lyrics suggest that Abel is engaging in a relationship that is not approved of by society, and he knows it’s wrong, but he still indulges in it. The lyrics of the pre-chorus describe a sense of physical intimacy between Abel and his lover, with him trapping her in his arms and expressing a desire to see what’s inside her heart. The chorus repeats the sentiment that even though the relationship is wrong, Abel still wants to be with the subject, who he refers to as “my girl.”\n",

      "In verse 1, Abel acknowledges that his girl thinks they are right for each other, but he knows that it’s not true and that it’s a lie.

Yeah, and then, we had this, it’s probably one of the earlier recordings on the album, like one of the first three joints we recorded. And I just had the first verse for a long time. And, I was so intimidated by it, ‘cause you know it’s kinda long. I was like “Man, this verse is so dope. If I write another verse it has to be the same length, and, I don’t know if I can top that verse ‘cause it was so good”, definitely one of the best raps, like, verses I’ve ever written. And, it’s kinda like talking about, that moment where you’re at peace, when you’re stoned and you’re in your place, and everything is just perfect, and it’s beyond words. This just feels like “oooooooh”, you know it’s just like, you can’t explain it. And, it’s that moment of just, happiness. I wrote that first verse, that first verse lived for about six or seven months. I was just gonna have that one verse and have the song, be that. And then, one day I woke up, grab my phone and started writing the second verse. And it just came so smoothly and came so easy to me. And, next thing you know, I laid it down and it was just perfect.

I was like, ‘This is hard,’ and I knew I was going to give it to Future. Then he skipped it. But we were talking the other day when we were at Drake’s house, and he said he skipped it because he knew it was one of his favorites. He said he listened to that beat every day for a month straight, without rapping or nothing. He was just listening to the beat like it was a song for a month straight, and he knew what he was going to do to it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I didn’t even know he [laid the vocals down]. A long time went by like, six or seven months. So I was like, let me try the beat with another artist, since he ain’t like it. Then he called me and said, ‘Hey, don’t ever get this beat out to nobody else. I got a crazy song on it.’\"\n",

      "    WikiContent: \"Donald Trump\" is a song by American rapper Mac Miller, released as the only single from his mixtape Best Day Ever. The melody played throughout the song is sampled from \"Vesuvius\" by Sufjan Stevens. The song's music video was uploaded to YouTube on March 3, 2011, while the single was released digitally on May 17, 2011.\n",
      "\n",
      "The money-inspired song references Donald Trump, who, five years after the song's release, was elected as the 45th president of the United States. Trump and Miller feuded over the song for years, with Trump demanding royalties for the use of his name.\n",
      "\n",
      "After performing the song for several weeks, Mac Miller released \"Donald Trump\" as a free download on February 9, 2011. Its music video, directed by Ian Wolfson, was uploaded to YouTube on March 3, 2011. The song was included in Miller's 2011 mixtape Best Day Ever, and commercially released by Rostrum Records as a single on May 17, 2011.\n",
      "\n",
      "The money-inspired song refers to Donald Trump, particularly Miller's ambitions to become wealthy and successful like him (\"Take over the world when I'm on my Donald Trump shit / Look at all this money, ain't that some shit?\"). According to Miller, the use of Trump's name was a last-minute decision, and he \"was just somebody who symbolized financial success to everybody at that time\". When the music video surpassed 20 million views in August 2011, Trump released a YouTube video congratulating Miller, and branded him \"the new Eminem\". Miller responded appreciatively but played down any comparisons between himself and Eminem.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the song garnered more streams in 2012, Trump took a more aggressive tone and demanded royalties for using his name, igniting a feud with Miller. In a January 2013 interview, Miller insulted Trump and said he was bothered by Trump taking credit for the song's success. He added that he could have referenced Bill Gates instead and that the name did not matter. In response, Trump threatened Miller with a lawsuit via a series of tweets. In July 2015, Trump changed his attitude toward Miller again when he ended an interview by praising Miller's song as it approached 100 million views. During Trump's 2016 presidential campaign, Miller denounced Trump and urged people not to elect him. Miller said on The Nightly Show with Larry Wilmore that he \"hated\" Trump, and described him as \"an egomaniacal, attention-thirsty, psychopathic, power-hungry, delusional waste of skin and bones\".\n",

On March 19, 2013, it was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America for digital download sales of over one million.

      "\n",
      "\"'I had just gotten off tour and I remember Jetson DM'ed me while I was on tour. He probably had the hottest year out of any producer, so I was very excited to get a message from him. As soon as I got back, I hit his line and he came to the studio with Pooh Beatz and we made a couple records. This was probably the third or fourth song that I did right after I got off tour. As soon as they played the beat, it was just this agreement amongst all of us. Like, you gotta snap on this, you can’t be no melodic, fun rap. Just really rap. So that was the focus, and I just went in. When he first got there, I was already aware that there’s a certain tempo he works at, because I heard a lot of DaBaby songs. So the first thing I was trying to get him to do was encourage him to speed his tempo up a little bit and go into a space I’m in. But coincidentally, when this beat came on, this ain’t even really the tempo I was trying to put him in. This is usually his space, and I couldn’t argue with it. It’s just so crazy. As soon as those pianos come in, it felt like there was no choice but to rap on this song. It’s just one of those beats. I heard the beat, then I wrote probably the first 30 bars. While I was in the booth, Jetson and Pooh, they had to go after I finished the first 30. But it sounded right so I did that 30 and then the next day I came back and I started punching some lines in. I was freestyling, so some of them are a little more simple because it was like, “Let me just ride the beat.” So it took two days to finish out. Then I sent it to Jetson and he was like, “Oh, you rapping rapping.” I couldn’t tell if he was pleased by that or not, because he said it like there’s a lot of rapping, but I’m like “Yes.” What was crazy is, everyone that heard it for the first week after it was finished, thought it was special. That’s why we chose to drop it because it was just a feeling. Everyone that came into the studio, when we played that song, the drums didn’t even have to drop for everyone to do the same thing. By the second bar, I was like, “Whoa,” every time. It’s just a feeling. It’s like, this is exciting.'\"\n",

      "    WikiContent: \"Money Trees\" is a song by American rapper Kendrick Lamar, taken from his major label debut studio album good kid, m.A.A.d city. The song, which appears as the fifth track on the album, features a guest appearance from his Black Hippy cohort, fellow American rapper Jay Rock. The song, produced by DJ Dahi, entered the Billboard Bubbling Under Hot 100 chart at number 19 due to high downloads, following the album's release. The song, mixed by Top Dawg engineer Derek \"MixedByAli\" Ali, features background vocals from American singer Anna Wise of Sonnymoon. Money Trees samples the Beach House song \"Silver Soul,\" from their 2010 album Teen Dream, as well as vocals from Kendrick’s \"Cartoon and Cereal\" and interpolates lyrics from E-40’s \"Big Ballin’ With My Homies\".\n",
      "\n",
      "On June 2, 2015, Jay Rock released the sequel \"Money Trees Deuce\" as a solo record with no feature from Kendrick Lamar.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Money Trees\" follows the storyline of \"Good Kid, M.A.A.D City\", as Kendrick Lamar reassesses what happened so far in the story. He talks about having sex with his love interest Sherane and going to tell his friends about it. He also assesses his current situation in his hometown Compton, California and reflects on the immortalization of his uncle after he was shot. At the end of the track, Lamar's mom calls him again and asks him to bring her car back, a recurring theme of the story. His dad has forgotten about the dominos he wanted by now, suggesting that Lamar \"has been out of the house for a while, driving around and trying to figure his life out, having just been attacked outside Sherane’s house.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "On August 28, 2013, Taj Stansberry revealed that he had begun to shoot a music video with Lamar and Jay Rock for \"Money Trees\". Stansberry, who called the song his favorite song on the album, said upon getting the job to come up with a treatment for the video that was due in a day, he dropped everything right then and created a website for the idea to present to Lamar. He added: \"I started literally at 9 in the morning and finished at 9 at night.\" As of June 2018, no further information has been announced regarding the video.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even without being released as a single, the song spent seven weeks on the US charts and peaked at number 19 on the US Billboard Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles chart.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Money Trees\" by Kendrick Lamar is a masterful work of art that showcases the artist's skillful use of language, storytelling, and social commentary. The song is built around a smooth and soulful beat, with Kendrick's lyrics seamlessly flowing over the instrumentation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The lyrics of \"Money Trees\" are rich with meaning and depth, exploring themes of temptation, greed, and the desire for success. Kendrick tells the story of growing up in a neighborhood where money is scarce and violence is prevalent, and the struggles he faced in trying to break free from that cycle.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the most impressive aspects of \"Money Trees\" is Kendrick's use of language. His lyrics are packed with clever wordplay, metaphors, and allusions, all of which serve to enhance the storytelling aspect of the song. The chorus, for example, is built around the refrain \"money trees is the perfect place for shade,\" which is a play on words that captures both the allure and danger of material wealth.\n",
      "\n",
      "The production on \"Money Trees\" is equally impressive, with the beat featuring a jazzy piano riff and smooth bassline that create a laid-back and mellow vibe. The mix is clean and crisp, with each element of the instrumental and vocal tracks blending together seamlessly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, \"Money Trees\" is a powerful and impactful work of art that showcases Kendrick Lamar's exceptional talent as a rapper and storyteller. The song's rich and complex lyrics, combined with its soulful and expertly crafted production, make it a standout track not just in Kendrick's catalog, but in the history of hip-hop as a genre. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Kendrick+Lamar/_/Money+Trees\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Like with 'Power Trip,' absolutely you couldn't point to any song on the radio and be like, 'Oh, this sounds like that'…everything from the beat to the way that I'm flowing, you've never really heard me so \"sleepy\". I really did them verses in my crib and just loved the way they felt.\"\n",

      "Cole originally sang the song's chorus himself, until a meeting with Jay-Z, who suggested that Cole reach out to Miguel. When J. Cole played it for Jay-Z, his first words were, 'Yo, you should get Miguel on this,'\" Cole recalls.\n",
      "\n",
      "The hip-hop/R&B song is a continuation of his song \"Dreams\" from his mixtape The Warm Up, in which he obsesses over the girl and devises his plan to kill her boyfriend. J. Cole speaks about his \"longest crush ever\". He later stated his hopes for the song: \"I've always wanted to use my voice to shift culture, even if just a millimeter.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The song debuted at number three on the US Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, selling 210,000 units, according to Nielsen SoundScan. It took off online as well, skyrocketing to more than 300,000 plays on Cole's SoundCloud page in less than a day. The song was sent to urban contemporary radio on February 19, 2013. The song has since peaked at number 19 on the US Billboard Hot 100, marking his second top 20 single in the US, and number 46 on the UK Singles Chart, becoming his highest-charting single there. The song also became a top five hit on the US Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart and the US Rap Songs chart, peaking at number five and number three, respectively. On July 15, 2013, the single was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for sales of over a million digital copies in the United States.\n",
      "\n",
      "In an interview on March 3, 2013 with radio personality Big Tigger, J. Cole said the visual to his new single \"Power Trip\" will be shot next week in his hometown of Fayetteville, North Carolina. The video treatment will be J. Cole's very own idea, which he mentioned in a previous interview that the idea came to mind as he was creating the song.[20] On April 8, 2013, along with announcing the release date for Born Sinner, he announced that the video for \"Power Trip\" would be released the following day, which it was on April 9.[21][22] J. Cole served as creative director on the video, and it was shot and directed by Nabil Elderkin and Mike Piscitelli.[23]\n",
      "\n",
      "The video begins with a strip-club scene, and then it follows J. Cole and one of his friends as they wait outside of a girl's house (Dinah Sade) – clearly the one who he has been up all night pining about with \"constant drinking and love songs.\" Soon, we learn that this tank-top-clad girl has a boyfriend: Cole's collaborator, Miguel. As that sequence fades away, we are left to wonder where Cole and his friend are driving to and why there are pieces of wood and plastic bags tied to the top of their car. A suspicious cop pulls them over, but finding nothing besides a shovel in the trunk, he lets them on their way. It is not until the duo finally park in the woods and remove the items from the top of the car that we understand the rapper's obsession has actually led to murder. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/J.+Cole/_/Power+Trip+(feat.+Miguel)\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

      "    WikiContent: \"Black and Yellow\" is a song by American rapper Wiz Khalifa from his third studio album \"Rolling Papers\". It was released on September 14, 2010, as the lead single from the album. The song was written by Khalifa, along with Stargate, who produced it. It was released as a CD single in honor of Record Store Day. The song peaked at number one on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming Wiz Khalifa's first number-one single in the US; he would top the chart again in 2015 with \"See You Again\".\n",
      "\n",
      "The song is about growing up in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and also Khalifa's car, a yellow Dodge Challenger Hemi with black stripes. He has stated that he got the car in those colors as a tribute to his hometown of Pittsburgh, whose official colors are black and gold, and its professional sports teams, most of whose colors are black and some variation of gold or yellow. The song itself does not mention Pittsburgh or sports, although the song's music video made the connection to Pittsburgh explicit, showing various iconic locations in the city, as well as apparel associated with the football team the Pittsburgh Steelers, the hockey team the Pittsburgh Penguins, and the baseball team the Pittsburgh Pirates. In the year after it was released, \"Black and Yellow\" spawned dozens of remixes, parodies and remakes, both in the U.S. and internationally, many of them made in tribute to a local sports team. At Super Bowl XLV in 2011, which featured the Steelers competing against the Green Bay Packers, the Steelers used \"Black and Yellow\" as their fight song, while the Packers used a remix by Lil' Wayne called \"Green and Yellow\", marking the first time both teams at the Super Bowl had used the same song. The song earned Khalifa his first Grammy nominations, for Best Rap Song and Best Rap Performance at the 2012 ceremony.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the issue dated October 2, 2010, \"Black and Yellow\" debuted at No. 100 on the Billboard Hot 100. It then dropped out the following week and re-entered at No. 64 on the issue dated October 30, 2010. On its eighteenth charting week, the song rose to No. 1 on the issue dated February 19, 2011, selling 198,000 digital copies that week. \"Black and Yellow\" has sold 4,144,922 digital copies since release. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Wiz+Khalifa/_/Black+and+Yellow\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

      "    WikiContent: Bitch, Don't Kill My Vibe\" (edited for radio as \"Trick, Don't Kill My Vibe\" or simply \"Don't Kill My Vibe\"), is a song by American hip hop recording artist Kendrick Lamar, from his major-label debut studio album Good Kid, M.A.A.D City (2012). The song, produced by frequent collaborator Sounwave of Top Dawg Entertainment in-house production team Digi+Phonics, heavily samples \"Tiden Flyver\", by Danish electronic group Boom Clap Bachelors. It was originally intended to be a collaboration with American singer Lady Gaga, but her contributions were ultimately excluded from the final recording due to timing issues. A remix of \"Bitch, Don't Kill My Vibe\" featuring American rapper Jay-Z was released as the album's fifth single on March 19, 2013, with the original version and another remix featuring British recording artist Emeli Sandé later being released.\n",
      "\n",
      "The song's music video, directed by The Lil Homie and OG Mike Mihail, notably ends with an abrupt cut to a black title screen reading \"Death to Molly\", intended to be a criticism by Lamar of glorification of the drug MDMA in contemporary hip hop music. \"Bitch, Don't Kill My Vibe\" peaked at number 28 on the United States Billboard Hot 100 chart, also reaching the top ten on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs and Hot Rap Songs charts. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Kendrick+Lamar/_/Bitch,+Don%E2%80%99t+Kill+My+Vibe\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

      "\n",
      "It’s a hard song to pin down what Ophelia was about as a singular idea – the lyrics in the song were sung in a stream-of -conscious, free sort of way during the demo process. But reading them back, i hear this idea of trying to remind myself not to fall in love with the momentary attention we were getting because i knew that was fleeting. I was in search of something more real. I was also feeling like i was observing someone else live a life somehow – surviving instead of living. With all the touring and shows for the 4-5 years on our first album, the repetition drives you a little mad.\n",

      "    WikiContent: \"Trance\" is a song by American record producer Metro Boomin and American rappers Travis Scott and Young Thug, from Metro's second studio album Heroes & Villains (2022). It was produced by Metro Boomin and Allen Ritter.\n",
      "\n",
      "The song was met with a generally mixed to negative reception. Its production has been criticized; Charles Lyons-Burt of Slant Magazine wrote, \"Metro is often just going about recycling what's worked on tracks that he's produced in the past, as with the sad-sack fiddle that he layers over the top of 'Trance'—the exact same one that he used on Savage Mode II's \"Rich Nigga Shit,\" which similarly featured Young Thug.\" Similarly, Hamza Riaz of Mic Cheque described the production in Heroes & Villains as \"the most skeletal we've ever heard Metro, excessively subdued in songs like 'Trance'\". Uproxx's Wongo Okon commented that the gloom in the song \"foreshadows the danger that lurks between the drums and hi-hats of Heroes & Villains.\" Writing for Complex, Peter A. Berry considered it among the songs which although \"can suffer from lyrical blandness, their melodies make them compelling anyways.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "In January 2023, an alternative version of the song featuring a verse from Canadian rapper Drake surfaced online. In an interview with DJ Drama on the Streetz Is Watchin Radio, Metro Boomin revealed that when they were in the studio once, Drake wanted to hear songs from Heroes & Villains and heard \"Trance\", which by then had been finished. Though Metro already liked the way it sounded and did not intend to alter it, Drake still recorded a verse for the song. Boomin explained, \"a couple parts was cool but like I just felt like just even with like Slime verse and Trav verse and the outro, it wasn't just no room. It wasn't nothing personal... I just ended up using the original and I guess the other one just leaked or something.\" <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Metro+Boomin/_/Trance+(with+Travis+Scott+&+Young+Thug)\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

      "    WikiContent: \"Last Christmas\" is a song by British pop duo WHAM!, released on Epic Records in 1984, on a double A-side with \"Everything She Wants\".\n",
      "\n",
      "It was written and produced by George Michael one half of the duo. The song has been covered by many artists throughout the years.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wham! had been a dominant force in the UK Singles Chart in 1984 and news that they were planning a Christmas single meant that a battle for the coveted Christmas #1 spot in the UK seemed set to be between Wham! and the year's other big act, Frankie Goes to Hollywood, who had achieved a third #1 in early December with \"The Power of Love\". However, the Band Aid project, helmed by Bob Geldof, produced the #1 single. Wham!'s offering peaked at #2 for much of the period, although George's involvement in Band Aid meant that Wham! still had an input. Wham! subsequently topped the monies raised by Band Aid by donating all of their \"Last Christmas/Everything She Wants\" royalties to the Ethiopian famine appeal. \"Last Christmas\" did make #1 in various other countries.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Last Christmas\", released in 1984, sold over 1.93 million physical copies and downloads, making it the eighth best-selling single of all time in the UK and the biggest selling single in UK chart history not to reach #1. A year later, it was re-issued for Christmas again (this time without a billed flip-side) and got to #6. A second re-issue at Christmas 1986 – by which time Wham! had split – stalled outside the top 40. The song gradually sold in Japan and finally became the best-selling single that did not reach that country's top-10 chart, selling more than 600,000 copies and peaking on the chart at #12 in 1992. Since 1997, the song enters the German Singlecharts every year and peaked at #4 in 2007. In the airplay charts, the song enters the Top 5 every year. In 2007, the track re-entered the UK Top 20 and hit the UK iTunes Top 10. In 2008, the song re-entered the UK Singles Chart again, this time at #36 and peaked at #26. In 2009, the song re-entered the UK Singles Chart at #39.\n",
      "\n",
      "On December 24, 2023, the song achieved a peak of 21,869,632 streams in a single day, making it the second most-streamed Christmas song on Spotify for that date, just behind Mariah Carey’s \"All I Want For Christmas Is You\". By December 2024, \"Last Christmas\" had been streamed over 1.7 billion times on Spotify. On December 10, 2024, the digital single was certified 7x Platinum by the RIAA, indicating U.S. sales of 7 million digital units. In the UK, it is certified 7x Platinum (2.1 million units sold), in Aistralia it is certified 7x Platinum too (490k units sold) and in Germany 4x Platinum (1.2 million). \"Last Christmas\" secured the Christmas number one spot for the second consecutive year in 2024, marking the first time an act has achieved back-to-back Christmas number ones. Its enduring popularity is further highlighted by its inclusion in Spotify's list of top 10 most-streamed holiday tracks of all time, where it holds the second position.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the mid-1980s, the publishing company Dick James Music, representing the songwriters of \"Can't Smile Without You,\" filed a lawsuit against George Michael, alleging that Wham!'s \"Last Christmas\" plagiarized their melody. The case was dismissed after a musicologist demonstrated that numerous songs shared similar chord progressions and melodies, undermining the plagiarism claim, an out of court settlement was reached in which the first year's royalties were donated to the one-year-old \"Band Aid\" charity. \n",
      "\n",
      "The music video to \"Last Christmas\" saw George and partner Andrew Ridgeley accompanying girlfriends to see friends at their home in an unspecified ski resort, although the cable-car that can be seen in two shots is from Saas-Fee, Switzerland. It became clear early on, however, that Andrew's girlfriend had previously been in a relationship with George, and it was to her character the song was aimed. The video also featured the duo's erstwhile backing singers Pepsi and Shirlie and Spandau Ballet bassist Martin Kemp, the boyfriend and future husband of Shirlie Holliman. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Wham%21/_/Last+Christmas\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

      "In the chorus, the heavy repetition of, “I know” suggests that Travis is feeling fed up and bothered by everyone judging him for being on drugs, however, because he’s so addicted, despite people caring for him, he brushes it off as though he feels they’re not looking out for him.\n",

      "With a lack of autotune — in comparison to other Travis Scott songs — the raw vocals play into the mysterious theme of the song which surrounds the topic of drugs.

      "    WikiContent: \"Borderline\" is a song by the Australian psychedelic music project Tame Impala. It is the third track on the 2020 studio album \"The Slow Rush\", and was released as a single on April 12, 2019 through Modular Recordings. The song was written by Kevin Parker, who performed all instruments and vocals. The song was influenced by yacht rock and disco, and the lyrics explore nihilism and insecurity. It was debuted during the band's performance on Saturday Night Live on March30; Parker ad-libbed much of the initial lyrics since he had not yet finalized them.\n",
      "\n",
      "The single release in 2019 predated any details about \"The Slow Rush\", which was delayed until 2020. Parker reworked the song for its inclusion on the album, making musical and lyrical changes. He revealed that he altered the song for the album mainly because he realized the bassline was not prominent enough. After releasing the album, the previously released single version of \"Borderline\" was removed from all streaming services.\n",
      "\n",
      "After spending extensive time working on Tame Impala's third album \"Currents\", Kevin Parker decided to shift away from being a perfectionist towards more spontaneity, adding that he \"finds something that sounds good I should just do it and not think about it\". \"Borderline\" was released as a single in 2019 but was reworked and re-released for multiple reasons. For one, Parker said he had accidentally made the bassline too quiet, and also wanted to change a few other elements of the song, as he had been pressured to release it prematurely. He elaborated: \"The way I describe it is the way it sounds now is the way I was hearing it when I released it the first time. So for me, the drums sounded just heaps more hard-hitting. And it was just things that I could hear in the song that I didn't realize no one else could, for example, the bassline, which was just kind of an example of lack of perspective when you're working on a song, or anything that anyone's working on ever. You lose perspective when you're working on it, which is good, too, it's kind of beautiful that you have no idea what you're doing.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "In a mention of the band's Saturday Night Live performance, \"Music Feeds\" called the song a \"groovy, toe-tapping lounge chiller\". Triple J ranked it 18th in the Triple J Hottest 100 of 2019. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Tame+Impala/_/Borderline\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

      "    WikiContent: “Circles” is the fourth single from Post Malone’s third studio album, 'Hollywood’s Bleeding'. The track continues the heartbreak theme from the third single, “Goodbyes”, as he struggles to maintain a strong relationship with his partner. Like “Goodbyes,” “Circles” fell victim to leaks before the official announcement. A snippet of the track originally surfaced online in July of 2019, with an early version of the song being leaked online later in August.\n",

      "In 2018, Post released the song “Stay” in a very similar fashion—the song was debuted on April 4, 2018, during his first Bud Light Dive Bar Tour show in Nashville, Tennessee. Like “Stay,” “Circles” features a more unique instrumental compared to the majority of Post’s discography, and is sonically similar to his 2016 track, “Hollywood Dreams / Come Down.”\n",
      "\n",
      "An official teaser was shared on August 5, 2019, and the full song was later debuted by Post during his Bud Light Dive Bar Tour performance on the same day in New York. During his performance at the Bud Light Dive Bar Tour, Post said that the track would be released the next week, leading many to believe it was supposed to be released on August 16. However, the song was not released on its original expected release date. In an Instagram post on August 28, 2019, Post announced the song would be released on August 30, 2019, alongside the song’s cover art. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Post+Malone/_/Circles\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

      "    WikiContent: \"Die with a Smile\" is a song by American singer-songwriters, Lady Gaga and Bruno Mars. It was released on August 16, 2024, through Interscope Records. Initially intended to be a standalone single, the song was later revealed to be included in Gaga's upcoming eighth studio album. Gaga and Mars wrote and produced the track alongside Dernst \"D'Mile\" Emile II and Andrew Watt while James Fauntleroy provided additional songwriting. The collaboration resulted from Mars inviting Gaga to his studio where he had been working on new music. He presented the track in progress to her and the duo finished writing and recording the song the same day. In the song, Gaga and Mars express a powerful longing to be with a loved one, highlighting the urgency and depth of their love in the face of uncertainty and potential endings.\n",

An accompanying music video directed by Mars and Daniel Ramos showing both singers performing the song on a retro stage set was released simultaneously alongside the track.

It was released on June 6, 2024, through Island Records, as the second single from her sixth studio album, Short n' Sweet. Produced by Jack Antonoff, the pop ballad contains musical influences of disco, country, and yacht rock; lyrically, the singer instructs her boyfriend not to blunder and blemish her reputation.\n",
      "\n",
      "An instant commercial success, the song debuted at number one in Ireland, becoming Carpenter's second consecutive chart-topping single in that country, and has also reached the top ten in Australia, Norway, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom.\n",
      "\n",
      "Following the commercial success of \"Espresso\", the singer announced her upcoming sixth studio album Short n' Sweet on June 3, 2024. She simultaneously promised an upcoming surprise for her fans, which would turn out to be the single. Only two days later, Carpenter took to social media to announce the song's release and share a teaser of the accompanying music video featuring cinematic visuals set to showcase her acting skills. The clip shows her wearing a lacy red outfit in a robbery-like setting, as well as engaging in a romance with a criminal played by her real-life boyfriend Barry Keoghan.\n",
      "\n",
      "The music video for \"Please Please Please\" serves as a sequel to the \"Espresso\" music video released earlier in 2024. In the music video for \"Espresso\", Carpenter gets arrested at the end. “I ended the last video getting arrested, so naturally I thought it would be satisfying to start the ‘Please Please Please’ video in jail,” said the singer. “I liked the idea of falling in love with a convict and being shocked and embarrassed every time he commits crimes. I was sooo lucky to get Barry Keoghan in the video ’cause he is just magic on screen.” said the singer after the music video was released. The Irish actor is rumored to be Carpenter's off-screen boyfriend after they started being seen together in December 2023 and throughout 2024.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bardia Zeinali, the music video director, commented about the inspiration for the music video to GQ. \"The concept was pretty collaborative. I had a brief from Sabrina's team – they wanted it to pick up from where “Espresso” left off and they wanted it to be about this person that Sabrina's character keeps falling for, that has this chaotic behaviour. So I just elaborated on that and started to think a bit more about specifically what happens. I liked this idea of there being a role reversal and an exchange of power towards the end. And things that were recurring, like her picking him up in the same place, same location, different day, different time.\", said the director to GQ. \"Pam and Tommy. Madonna and Dennis Rodman. Tarantino was a big reference point. Natural Born Killers. Bonnie and Clyde, obviously. Even Thelma & Louise. We were really looking at film references more than anything else and pop culture references in terms of what we wanted the spirit of this moment to be. Even J Lo and Ben Affleck – not to reference, but to capture that spirit. It's similar in the sense that they're this really exciting young couple, both having big moments in their respective careers, coming together and making a piece of art. But this is very much not real life – it's a story,\" said the director. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Sabrina+Carpenter/_/Please+Please+Please\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

      "After having moved from his hometown of Woodbridge, Virginia to Los Angeles in 2022, Richman quickly garnered attention for his \"signature production style\" without being confined to \"genre labels\". In 2023, he was recognized by American musician Brent Faiyaz with whom he embarked on his 'F*ck the World' tour that also exposed him to a larger audience.

      "    WikiContent: “Not Like Us” is Kendrick Lamar’s fourth dedicated diss track toward Drake. On the track, Kendrick avenges the West Coast for Drake’s controversial use of 2Pac and Snoop Dogg A.I. voice filters on his song “Taylor Made Freestyle,” Drake’s second diss towards the Compton-born emcee, released on Instagram and removed shortly thereafter because of copyright claims from the estate of the late Tupac Shakur. Kendrick raps over a bouncy Mustard-produced beat which, typical of Mustard’s style, is inspired by hyphy, a genre of Northern Californian hip hop. Kendrick’s zany vocal inflections and fast flows are reminiscent of Bay Area legend E-40, a personal favorite of his.\n",

      "Amongst other disses, notably calling Drake a snitch and culture vulture, Kendrick doubles down — and progresses — on prior-made allegations of sexual deviancy. This time, he outright calls Drake a “pedophile.”\n",
      "The YouTube thumbnail features a Google Maps screenshot of Drake’s mansion at Park Lane Circle in Toronto, Canada. Park Lane Circle is “a Toronto oasis where celebrities love to build extremely lavish mansions.” The thumbnail, edited in a way that closely resembles the modern sex offender registry, which pinpoints the residency of a convicted offender, is continuing the thread of allegations by Kendrick Lamar that Drake is a sexual predator, It insinuates that Drake’s mansion, nicknamed “The Embassy,” is a hub for illegal activities, particularly pedophilia and/or sex trafficking.\n",
      "The track was first teased on Twitter by two persons: one of Kendrick’s associates and Anthony “Top Dawg” Tiffith, the founder of TDE, the label and collective that Kendrick belonged to before retiring to his pgLang enterprise. The first tweet stated that “he’s nowhere near done.” Top Dawg posted,“Dot, I see dead people 💀” hinting at the opening line of the song, which dropped approximately two hours later. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Kendrick+Lamar/_/Not+Like+Us\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

      "The band first teased the track along their 2020 Déjà Vu Tour, as seen on the setlist for the Toronto show on the tour.

      "\"HEAT WAVES IS OUT NOW. it’s about realising you can’t make everyone happy. and realising it’s ok to be defeated by something. we are often expected to ‘be strong’ and to swallow our sadness. failing to do that is seen as weakness. so we try to cover up our feelings and hide inside of TV shows or video games or drink or drugs. but being vulnerable should be a positive thing. there was a review in a big publication we got early on that said i was ‘too effeminate’ because of the way I sang and that that was weak and gross. its 2020. there’s no space for that sh*t anymore. the music video is out too. it’s meant to reference the sentiments in the song…about being defeated and unable to save something…but tweaked the context a little. I’ll do another post about it tomorrow explaining more. i hope you like the song, its a special one to me.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "\"It began with a personal experience that everyone has had: A friend starts dating someone and slowly, they change the way they dress. And then the way they talk. And then everything. Eventually it gets to the point where you’re like, ‘Who is that? Where did my friend go?’ Well, this song is about realizing that it’s happened to you, that it’s you that’s changed. You’ve become someone that you aren’t. I was trying to figure out whether it’s a good thing or a bad thing, but ultimately I think it’s about hitting a wall—a point where you can’t change anymore or you’ll lose the foundation of who you are. You’ll become an attachment for this other person. It’s happened to me and I’ve seen it happen to so many friends. And there’s a moment when you see your reflection and you’re like, ‘Oh, fuck.’ All of the lyrics play into that—mirages, hallucinations, things like that.\"\n",

      "\"this video is a love letter to live music and the culture and togetherness surrounding it. It was filmed at the peak of the lockdown in my neighbourhood in East London by the lovely people who live around me, just using their phones. These are people who are usually out at shows, in galleries, going to cinemas etc. These venues are left empty now, and many of them will not survive. The song is about loss and longing, and ultimately realizing you are unable to save something…and this video is about that but for art, being together, and human contact. Huge love and thank you’s to everyone who got involved and helped out. When everyone was leaning out of their windows filming, I felt that same sense of togetherness and spine-tingling energy that happened at live shows. It made the coldness of performing to an empty room with the band stuck on screens feel even more heart-breaking\"\n",

The narrator is aware of the negative consequences an unhealthy relationship can bring, but they also find themselves helplessly drawn to the other person.The chorus highlights the juxtaposition of the relationship and produces a craving for the unattainable person and place. The narrator desires the person in spite of knowing that it's not a good idea and fantasizes about the future of this relationship. The lyrics allude to a passionate and fleeting romance between two people who are emotionally unable to commit to each other in a meaningful way. The message of the song is that although you may find yourself in a relationship with someone who isn't good for you, to still be open to the possibility of love. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Lana+Del+Rey/_/Diet+Mountain+Dew\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The singer clarified that the songs \"could not make the original release\" for various reasons, but still fit the themes of \"gluttony, limbo, violence and the outward 'ascent'\". He first teased the song the same day on TikTok in a clip that features him drawing a sketch of a skeleton. \"Too Sweet\" was surprise-released as the opening track to the project on 22 March.\n",

      "    WikiContent: “BLUE” is the closing and a standout track from Billie Eilish’s third studio album HIT ME HARD AND SOFT. The song is a fusion of two older, unreleased tracks: “True Blue” and “Born Blue.” Lyrically, “Blue” explores themes of heartache and emotional detachment, reflecting on a failed relationship and feelings of inadequacy. The repeated imagery of the color blue emphasizes sadness, regret, and longing. Billie sings about trying to move on but feeling trapped in her emotional state, contrasting her desire to live in “black and white” with the overwhelming “blue” emotions she can’t escape.\n",
      "\n",
      "The song’s second part deepens its emotional impact by exploring childhood trauma, touching on themes of parental neglect and inherited pain. This part ties personal experiences with broader reflections on identity and growing up in the public eye, as both Billie and the person she’s addressing seem to struggle with the consequences of their upbringing.\n",
      "\n",
      "The production, helmed by her brother Finneas, incorporates atmospheric elements that build the song’s introspective and melancholic tone, making “Blue” a powerful emotional closer for the album. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Billie+Eilish/_/BLUE\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

      "    WikiContent: \"Family Affair\" is a 2001 hit song for Mary J. Blige, produced by Dr. Dre. It was taken from her fifth album, No More Drama, and was responsible for popularizing the terms \"hateration\" and \"dancery\" in the US, as well as contributing to the popularity of the word \"crunk\".\n",
      "\n",
      "The music for \"Family Affair\" was originally created in a jam session between Dr. Dre and musicians Mel-Man, Camara Kambon and Mike Elizondo. Later, Blige heard the song and she and her brother Bruce Miller contributed the lyrics and melody. Finally, Dr. Dre produced Blige's vocals, but this was done at a distance because at the time he was busy filming the movie Training Day. The music video was directed by Dave Meyers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Dre created an initial version of the musical portion of \"Family Affair\" in studio on September 13, 2000, using a bass player and a keyboard player. His studio engineers entitled this version of the song \"Fragile\" for record-keeping purposes.[5] Near the end of 2000, he sent Blige the instrumental track.\n",
      "\n",
      "Blige recorded vocals over the music based on lyrics penned by Miller, Kambon and Elizondo. Several weeks later, on January 10, 2001, a near-final but non-lyrical portion of \"Fragile\" was transferred from digital to analog format and renamed \"Family Affair\". In late May or early June 2001, at Dr. Dre's suggestion, Blige added a bridge to the song, for which she alone crafted the lyrics. A remix featuring rappers Jadakiss and Fabolous appears on the US CD single.\n",
      "\n",
      "The single topped the Billboard Hot 100 for six weeks from November 3, 2001. It was Blige's first Hot 100 number-one, although she had previously reached number two with \"Not Gon' Cry\" in 1996.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2007, this song was used on a Propel Fitness Water commercial. According to Rolling Stone's Magazine Dr.Dre earned 2 million dollars in royalties from the mega-hit.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2008, for Billboard magazine's 50th Anniversary, \"Family Affair\" was listed as the 79th best single on the The Billboard Hot 100 All-Time Top Songs. While at the end of 2009 was named the 12th most successful song from 2000 to 2009, on the Billboard Hot 100 Songs of the Decade.

      "    WikiContent: \"Anaconda\" is a song by Trinidadian rapper and singer Nicki Minaj, from her third studio album, The Pinkprint. Released on August 4, 2014, by Young Money Entertainment, Cash Money Records, and Republic Records as the second single from the album, the song was produced by Polow da Don, DJ Spydr, and Da Internz, and prominently samples \"Baby Got Back\" by Sir Mix-a-Lot. The song peaked at number two on the US Billboard Hot 100, becoming Minaj's highest-charting single at the time. The song also peaked within the top ten in Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom, the top forty in Austria, France, and Portugal, and the top fifty in the Czech Republic.\n",
      "\n",
      "Colin Tilley directed an accompanying video for the song, which was released on August 19, 2014. Following the video's release, it broke the 24-hour streaming record on Vevo by accumulating 19.6 million views on its first day of release. In 2021, Anaconda became the first music video for a solo female rap song to hit 1 billion views. To further promote the song, Minaj performed it live at the 2014 MTV Video Music Awards and also performed it at Fashion Rocks and the iHeartRadio Music Festival. \"Anaconda\" was nominated for Best Rap Song at the 2015 Grammy Awards. The song was also nominated for two categories at the 2015 MTV Video Music Awards, Best Female Video, and Best Hip-Hop Video, winning the latter.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the United States, the song debuted at No. 3 on the Digital Songs chart selling 141,000 digital downloads in its first week. Additionally, as Minaj shared lead credit on \"Bang Bang,\" which was No. 2 on that same chart in the same week, Minaj became the first lead actor to have two concurrent songs in the top three of the chart since Taylor Swift did it on the list dated September 22, 2012. On the Billboard Hot 100, the song debuted at No. 19, marking Minaj's 51st Hot 100 entry and subsequently breaking out of a tie with Michael Jackson for overall career Hot 100 entries.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the week ending September 6, 2014, \"Anaconda\" jumped 39-2 on the Hot 100, blocked from the top spot by Swift's \"Shake It Off\". It became Minaj's highest charting single on that chart at the time. It marked her eleventh top-ten single. Its leap into the runner-up position was brought on primarily by the release of its music video, which garnered 32.1 million domestic streams in its first week. That streaming total caused it to consequentially skyrocket 42-1 on Billboard's Streaming Songs chart. It is the largest one-week streaming sum since Miley Cyrus' \"Wrecking Ball\" received 36.4 million streams for the week ending September 28, 2013. Additionally, the 39-2 ascent for \"Anaconda\" marks the second-biggest jump ever within the Hot 100's top 40. Only Black Eyed Peas made a bigger leap in the region when \"Boom Boom Pow\" blasted 39-1 on April 18, 2009. \"Anaconda\" was certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in November 2014 and has sold 1.3 million copies in the US as of December 2014. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Nicki+Minaj/_/Anaconda\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

I didn't think he was even going to come and this was the song that was written for him.

The song was written by Melanie Martinez & Jennifer Decilveo, while production was handled by Jennifer Decilveo & Michael Keenan. This tells the story of Cry Baby feeling like she’s nothing more than a friend to the boy she likes. He is constantly inviting her over to play games, but Cry Baby feels that he does not care about her as much as she cares about him. Frustrated, she outwardly proclaims she is just as uncommitted as he is, and how she's tired of all the games she has to play to stay with him. She wishes she didn’t care about his antisocial behavior towards her, and wishes she could stop chasing after him.\n",

And he sent me all the home videos. He was like, “Yeah, no problem”. And then I started watching them and I was hit with this wave of emotion that’s kind of like everything that I suppressed came back up. And I don’t know, it kind of made my dad and I reconnect. And it was the weirdest thing. I really didn’t expect it to, but I was like, “Wow, okay. I think I’ve been thinking about this all wrong”. And it wasn’t all bad. And now, you know we’re in touch again. And it’s getting better for sure.

It was written by the band alongside Jamie Scott, Julian Bunetta and John Ryan, while the production was handled by Bunetta and Ryan. The song was released on 14 November 2014 as the second and final single from their fourth studio album \"Four\". A moderate commercial success, the track is one of the band's most critically acclaimed, receiving praise for contemplating the fleeting nature of life with depth and maturity.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Night Changes\" was revealed as the album's second single in an interview with radio host Scott Mills. The track was released on 14 November 2014, three days before the album's release.\n",
      "\n",
      "Developing on the themes of \"Live While We're Young\" and \"Story of My Life\", the song explores the rapid passage of time, seizing the moment in life, and gaining love along the way. The harmonies in the chorus, backed by rounds of \"Oohs\", give the song added depth and a \"big contemplative feel.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The official music video was released on 21 November 2014 and directed by Ben Winston. This was the last video of One Direction with the member Zayn as he departed from the band on 25 March 2015. Liam Payne's real-life girlfriend Sophia Smith was involved in the shoot, but did not appear on-screen.\n",
      "\n",
      "The video is a point of view of going on a date with all members of One Direction. The five dates take place in five different locations: a date with Zayn at an Italian restaurant (which apparently he owns as he greets cooks in the back and introduces his date to a waiter), a drive in the country with Louis, a night in playing Monopoly and Jenga next to a fireplace with Niall, ice skating with Harry and at a carnival with Liam.\n",
      "\n",
      "As their date progresses, it goes from best to worst. Zayn's date's ex-boyfriend comes in and pours water and food on Zayn, which prompts her to leave Zayn as he looks on in disbelief. Next, Harry spots a couple doing a trick on the ice rink and attempts to do it with his date, but both wound up being injured. Liam and his date go on a ride in the carnival, but Liam becomes nauseated and throws up in his date's hat. Niall tends to his fireplace, but his sweater catches on fire and goes to grab a towel to put it out, only to tip over a jug that stains his date's dress. Lastly, Louis gets pulled over by the police and attempts to joke with the policeman, who becomes displeased and places Louis under arrest, and the date sees Louis in the back of the police car heading away from her. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/One+Direction/_/Night+Changes\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

      "The song and its accompanying dance are named after famed Atlanta choreographer Toosie, who on March 29—five days before the song’s release—posted a video of him, along with other dancers Hiii Key, Ayo & Teo, doing the dance, which later went viral.\n",

      "\n",
      "“[Drake] had a record idea and needed me to come up with a dance to it. Everybody was contributing little moves, and slowly but surely, we started piecing it together. He went back and finished the song after we sent him the dance. Then he called me, and he was like “Yo, everybody is in love with the dance. Everybody’s been doing it. We’re all calling it the Toosie Slide right now. It’s sticking and we might just call the song that.” Later on, he let me know he was officially going to name the song “Toosie Slide.” I was in shock. I couldn’t even believe it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The single is Drake’s first official release on all streaming platforms and third release overall in 2020, following the Future-assisted “Desires,” which was released in January, and “Chicago Freestyle” and “When to Say When”—both which were released four weeks prior to this song. “Toosie Slide,” along with the three other songs were later placed on Drake’s fifth mixtape, Dark Lane Demo Tapes. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Drake/_/Toosie+Slide\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

      "“I wrote this song last August while we were on tour in Japan. It was about a million degrees outside, so at the end of each day, I’d lie down on my hotel bed and turn the AC on full blast and play these chords. The chorus came first, then the first verse. The second verse was [written on] a completely different day, but that’s why I like that part so much.“\n",
      "\n",
      "In an interview with Pitchfork, Finneas explained:\n",
      "\n",
      "“I liked it at this really slow tempo and I also liked itwith kind of a backbeat and this sort of Gorillaz “Feel Good Inc” rhythm running through it. One of the things that I always try to do in my production is help articulate shifts in certain ways, so I really wanted the moment where the drums break in and the bass breaks in to feel sort of enhanced and accentuated, and I felt that the easiest way to do that was to muffle all of the high end out of the intro and then to just pump in to a hi-fi feeling with the drums and the bass. The other good example I could give is that the same kind of effect happens on the beginning of “Mr. Brightside” by The Killers, and in that one, they use panning in a really interesting way. They have the guitar hard panned and the drums hard panned and the vocal is really muffled. And then when the second part of the first verse comes in, it all busts out into a million hertz. It’s probably the primary inspiration. At the end of the track, when the drums and the bass cut out and it just goes to only acoustic guitar and only my vocal, I wanted to sort of keep some ear candy in and so I layered in this recording of frogs and crickets in a field up in northern California. The challenge was just being willing to abandon ship at the end of the song, and have the last 45 seconds be a live take, which is kind of risky because sometimes you can lose a lot of momentum. But I felt that in that song’s case, it needed to have this super different feeling for the last 45 seconds.“\n",

      "    WikiContent: \"Safe and Sound\" is a song by American indie pop duo Capital Cities, written and produced by band members Ryan Merchant and Sebu Simonian. The song was released as a single on January 6, 2011, and first appeared on their debut EP \"Capital Cities\", later serving as the lead single from their debut studio album \"In a Tidal Wave of Mystery\". \"Safe and Sound\" became the duo's breakout hit, peaking at number eight on the United States Billboard Hot 100 and achieving commercial success in several other territories. Three music videos were produced for the single, with the third video, directed by Grady Hall and set in the Los Angeles Theatre, later being nominated for Best Music Video at the 56th Annual Grammy Awards. It is the theme song for the Washington Capitals of the National Hockey League.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Safe and Sound\" is a synth-pop, dance-pop and alternative rock song, and was written and produced by Capital Cities members Ryan Merchant and Sebu Simonian. It features a prominent trumpet line, which was only incorporated into its production after eight previous takes of the song.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first music video for \"Safe and Sound\" was self-produced and edited by the band and uploaded to their official YouTube account on February 24, 2011. It features alternating historical film clips of dancing and war from the last century generally arranged in chronological order. Another video, directed by Jimmy Ahlander, was released on October 21, depicting the duo being led through a junkyard by a monk.\n",
      "\n",
      "The third and most well-known video for the song was directed by Grady Hall and released on April 25, 2013. The video is set in the Los Angeles Theatre and depicts Capital Cities performing on stage as dancers of all types (1940s swing dancers, 1970s roller disco skaters, 1990s hip-hop dancers, etc.) emerge from pictures on the wall and film clips from different time periods in the theater's history come to life and compete in dance-offs. It received a nomination in the Best Music Video category at the 56th Annual Grammy Awards.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Safe and Sound\" first gained commercial success in Germany following its use in a Vodafone commercial, later topping the German Media Control singles chart. A sleeper hit, it peaked at number eight on the Billboard Hot 100 in September 2013, over two-and-a-half years after its initial release. It has sold over two million copies in the United States as of January 2014. It also reached #2 on the Mainstream Top 40 chart. In the United Kingdom, the single was added to the BBC Radio 2 playlist on August 31, 2013; following its official single release in the country the following month, it peaked at number 42 on the UK Singles Chart. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Capital+Cities/_/Safe+and+Sound\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

      "The biggest hit version of the song was recorded by Perry Como in 1957, and became a hit in early 1958. The peak position is hard to track precisely, due to the multiple charts used in Billboard. The overall impact of the song probably fell just below the top ten. The song was also a 1958 hit in Italy and in the United Kingdom in a version recorded by Ronnie Hilton, reaching #22 on the UK Singles Chart. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Perry+Como/_/Magic+Moments\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

      "    WikiContent: \"Your Body Is a Wonderland\" is a song written and recorded by American singer-songwriter John Mayer. It was released in October 2002 as the second single from his debut studio album, Room for Squares (2001). It reached number 18 on the US Billboard Hot 100 and number nine on the New Zealand Singles Chart.\n",
      "\n",
      "Background\n",
      "During his \"VH1 Storytellers\" performance, Mayer stated that he wrote the song about his first girlfriend at age 14. The song was actually named \"Strawberry Wonderland\" but was later changed by Mayer.\n",
      "\n",
      "There has been speculation that Mayer wrote the song about Jennifer Love Hewitt, whom he dated in 2002, but she denied it. Hewitt told Entertainment Weekly, \"My body is far from a wonderland. My body is more like a pawnshop. There's a lot of interesting things put together, and if you look closely you'd probably be excited, but at first glance, not so much\".\n",
      "\n",
      "According to the liner notes, a toy piano is used as an instrument in the song.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lyrical content\n",
      "The line \"I'm never speaking up again\", sung in the background, is also prominently featured in the chorus to the song \"My Stupid Mouth\", which appears just before the song on Room For Squares.\n",
      "\n",
      "Critical reception\n",
      "Billboard said the song showcases Mayer's \"smooth, casual singing style and barroom instrumentation.\" In 2003, \"Your Body Is a Wonderland\" won Mayer the Grammy Award for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance. The song ranked at No. 28 on Blender magazine's list of the \"50 Worst Songs Ever\".\n",
      "\n",
      "Music video\n",
      "The video starred the actress Holly Lynch. The video was directed by Jim Gable, and edited by Scott C. Wilson.\n",
      "\n",
      "Appearances in the media\n",
      "In 2006, the song was used in an episode of U.S. version of The Office, entitled \"A Benihana Christmas\". Characters Michael Scott and Andy Bernard sing the song as a karaoke duet. Mayer agreed to let the show use the song, in exchange for a Dundie, which was for \"Tallest Music Dude\".\n",
      "\n",
      "In the episode of Family Guy titled \"Stew-Roids\", Stewie sings a song in which he pronounces the word \"body\" like \"bah-dy\", which he then explains \"That's how John Mayer would say it\"; a reference to the pronunciation of the word in \"Your Body Is a Wonderland\".\n",
      "\n",

      "    WikiContent: “Frankenstein” is the lead single to Claire Rosinkranz' EP \"6 Of A Billion\". “Frankenstein” offers a fresh new vibe in the Rosinkranz catalog, as it has her most clever lyrics to date. She reflects on what she would like in a boy and designs her perfect partner. His alias? Frankenstein.\n",
      "\n",
      "She explains to DORK, “I imagine somebody who’s been in a bunch of past relationships, and they haven’t worked out for whatever reason. The guy is just too egotistical. So, you’re fed up and actually try to Frankenstein your perfect boy together. It’s honestly innocent, carefree, and cute.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The music video for the song shows so many funny visuals. Getting inspiration from a portrait she saw at a museum, the rising star designs her man to be just like the one in the art piece. As Claire narrates what her perfect partner would be like, we start seeing her start to design a real-life Frankenstein. It’s clever like the lyrics, fun like her personality, and also enthralling like her music.\n",

      "    WikiContent: The Smiths' classic “There Is a Light That Never Goes Out” is a sacred song by now, one that makes fans across the globe join hands and mope together.\n",
      "\n",
      "The song was the second single off of The Smiths' 1986 \"The Queen Is Dead\" album (although released as a single six years after the album was released).\n",
      "\n",
      "The song became The Smiths' second song to top BBC Radio One DJ John Peel’s Festive Fifty poll in his 1986 edition. As a single, the song reached number 25 on the UK Singles Chart.\n",
      "\n",
      "The song has been referenced in multiple works of art, such as the novel Trainspotting, the movie (500) Days of Summer and the TV series Orange is the New Black. Multiple artists have also covered it, including superfan Noel Gallagher and Miley Cyrus.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fan favorite has stood out for its ideal balance of Morrissey’s irreplaceable voice and lyricism and the ingenious guitar ability of Johnny Marr.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 1993, guitarist, Johnny Marr, told Select magazine that he thought this was “the best song” that he had ever heard: “I didn’t realise that ‘There Is A Light That Never Goes Out’ was going to be an anthem but when we first played it I thought it was the best song I’d ever heard.” In the same interview, Marr revealed that the song’s intro was lifted from The Rolling Stones' cover of “Hitch Hike” by Marvin Gaye. The Velvet Underground also swiped this intro for their song, “There She Goes Again.” Marr recalled: “There’s a little in-joke in there just to illustrate how intellectual I was getting. At the time everyone was into The Velvet Underground and they stole the intro to ‘There She Goes Again’ – ‘da da-da-da, da-da!’ – from The Rolling Stones' version of ‘Hitch Hike,’ the Marvin Gaye song. I just wanted to put that in to see whether the press would say, ‘Oh it’s the Velvet Underground!’ Cos I knew that I was smarter than that. I was listening to what The Velvet Underground was listening to.” <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Smiths/_/There+Is+a+Light+That+Never+Goes+Out+-+2011+Remaster\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

      "\n",
      "The song is a musical continuation of the band’s 2013 single “Robbers”, opting for a gothic piece with a huge hall reverb. Collaborating with Warren Ellis, the strings and major key creates an orchestral yet grounded musical arrangement.\n",
      "\n",
      "It features a duet with Carly Holt, the wife of The 1975’s lead guitarist Adam Hann. Prior to its release, Pitchfork described the song as “moody”, comparing Healy’s vocals to Morrissey.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Warren Ellis from Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds came in to do the arrangement for this song. It was really simple—it sounded like ‘With or Without You’ essentially—and he made it all weird and shoegazey. Even though it’s major key, he gave it this terror, which makes my performance in it a lot less romantic because everything is mushing together, and it’s violent. I think this has a similar vibe to ‘Inside Your Mind’ from the third album. I’ve always loved those kinds of [David] Cronenberg, body-horror analogies, the tension between death and sex. I think that the morose can be quite sensual, and there’s quite a bit of that in my work.\"\n",

      "\"Just like I knew that ‘IILWY’ through the video was going to be a continuation of ‘A Change of Heart’, I kinda felt like musically ‘About You’ was a continuation of ‘Robbers’. I suppose stylistically it was a little bit cleaner, and then we had this idea of why don’t we go full Phil Spector, so rather than being able to feel the rhythm it’s just this huge hall reverb, like ‘Be My Body’. That was the version Warren Ellis got hold of. So all of the distortion – the moving, weird distortion – that’s actually Warren’s strings. That’s what gives the simplicity of the song – even though it’s in major key – this gothic feeling.\" <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+1975/_/About+You\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

      "    WikiContent: \"Hold On, We're Going Home\" is a song by Canadian rapper Drake, featuring the R&B duo Majid Jordan. The song was produced by Noah \"40\" Shebib, OVO Sound's Majid Jordan and Nineteen85, and it is the second single from his third studio album \"Nothing Was the Same\", and was released for digital download on August 7, 2013, following the 2013 OVO Fest. It was later released to mainstream and rhythmic contemporary radio on August 13, 2013.\n",
      "\n",
      "The song peaked at number four on the US Billboard Hot 100 and the UK Singles Chart, as well as number five on the singles chart in his native Canada. The song received positive reviews from music critics and was named the best song of 2013 by Pitchfork Media as well as number 21 on its \"Best Tracks of the Decade\" list.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before \"Hold On, We're Going Home\" was released, Drake had an interview with MTV News about the song during the 4th Annual OVO Fest saying, \"It's me and 40 just channeling our Quincy Jones/Michael Jackson production duo,... Obviously no offense to the greats, I know we're not anywhere near that — it's just us kinda doing our thing, humbly attempting.\" He also added, \"It's not a rap record,... It's not 'Versace,' it's not 'Started from the Bottom.' In approaching this album I was like man, it would be great if we had a record that was played at weddings in 10 years or that people that are away from their families in the Armed Forces could listen to. Something that just [has] timeless writing, timeless melody. So I did it with the group that we signed to OVO called Majid Jordan.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hold On, We're Going Home\" debuted at number five on the US Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, making it Drake's thirty-third top 10 hit on the chart. This accomplishment broke the tie for second-most top ten hits with singer R. Kelly, only trailing behind rapper Lil Wayne, who has 36. The song also made the top ten in the Canadian Hot 100, peaking at number five, making it his highest-charting single in his home country. In the song's fifth week on the US Billboard Hot 100, it became Drake's 13th top ten hit, climbing at number eight. This feat gave him the most top ten hits of the year with four, including \"Fuckin' Problems\" (number 8), \"Started from the Bottom\" (number 6), and \"Love Me\" (number 9). The song reached number four on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, becoming Drake's first song to reach the top five of the Hot 100 since \"Find Your Love\". The song peaked at number one on the Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. It sold over two million copies as of January 2014. The song sold 207,000 copies in Canada in 2013. The single reached a peak of number four in the United Kingdom, giving Drake his highest-peaking single there at the time (\"One Dance\" later reached number one in 2016). It also received heavy rotation on South African radio stations, peaking a number one on the South African Airplay Chart. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Drake/_/Hold+On,+We%27re+Going+Home\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

      "    WikiContent: After realizing he could sing after finishing 12th grade, David Kushner began writing songs with a close friend while living in Florida. He played the guitar and taught music to himself. Eventually, Kushner worked with a vocal coach and started writing songs he believed \"will speak to people\". He eventually released the singles \"Miserable Man\" and \"Mr. Forgettable\", which preceded his debut extended play Footprints I Found.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kushner wrote the song \"Daylight\" with Hayden Robert Huders, Jeremy Fedryk, and John Bruce Williams. Miserable Music Group released it as a single on April 14, 2023. Kushner described his inspiration for the song: \"With my song 'Daylight,' I aim to convey the paradoxical desire for something that is simultaneously harmful to oneself, using elements of light and darkness, the lyrics 'Oh I love it and I hate it at the same time you and I drink the poison from the same vine' encapsulate this concept.\" One of the fastest songs he ever wrote, its story is based on biblical allusions he found inspirational as a child.\n",

      "Luke Shaw and Landon Juern directed the music video for \"Daylight\", which was released alongside it, and features a pensive and soulful Kushner at a woodland church, along with the elements fire, water, air, and ash. The song serves as the second single from his upcoming debut studio album. It debuted at number six on the Spotify Global chart dated April 14, with 4,473,193 streams.  \"Daylight\" is projected to debut at number two on the UK Singles Chart, becoming Kushner's first top-10 single. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/David+Kushner/_/Daylight\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The singer looks back on a past where people expected her to \"get ratchet\" and be wild, but now she finds herself stuck in a place of wanting more - needing something beyond the superficial lifestyle others glorify. She knows some of the love she's seeking is already inside of her, but she can't quite see it, as if she's \"blind\". She reflects on how confusing it is to be expected to fall in line with trends and relationships dictated by society and instead chooses to rely on herself. In the face of insecurity and personal battles, she finds a strength in knowing that she has the power to create something better for herself. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/SZA/_/Blind\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

In this down-tempo love song, Sia confesses her love to her snowman, a metaphor for the man she loves. While ostensibly a holiday tune, this song can also be read as a prequel to Sia’s “The Girl You Lost To Cocaine,” in which she dubs her addicted former lover “still as a snowman.” That song is about the process of leaving, but this one is about staying – perhaps with the implication of the narrator also continuing her addiction so she can stay frosty with her “snowman.” <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Sia/_/Snowman\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

      "    WikiContent: “Gimme Love” is the third single from Joji’s second studio album, Nectar. The song is a love ballad from Joji, with him beckoning for affection from his lover, citing the pain it causes him when they don’t do so.\n",

      "The track starts with a darker, lo-fi electronic instrumental that Joji is known for, featuring fast, clapping snares and droning synthesizers in the background. However, the upbeat acoustic ending of the song is a stark difference from the darker vibes of Joji’s previous work.\n",

The listing was quickly taken down from the site once fans got ahold of the information it contained. A month later, an upcoming single from Joji was teased by his label on April 12, 2020, with more audio and video teasers on the following days. Joji finally announced the title of the track on April 15, 2020, a day before its release.\n",

During this time he featured on the Billboard Hot 100 chart-toppers \"California Love\" and \"No Diggity\", while also producing Snoop Dogg and Eminem's debut studio albums Doggystyle and The Slim Shady LP, respectively. The stakes were higher for the sequel to The Chronic, so Dre recruited Jay-Z to ghostwrite lyrics for the former's comeback single, \"Still D.R.E.\". \"At first, he wrote about diamonds and Bentleys,\" Dre told Blaze magazine in 1999. \"So I told Jay to write some other shit. Jigga sat for 20 minutes and came back with some hard-ass, around-the-way L.A. shit.\" In an interview on The Breakfast Club, Snoop Dogg elaborated on Jay-Z's contributions on the song. \"He wrote Dre’s shit and my shit and it was flawless,\" he said. \"It was 'Still D.R.E.' and it was Jay-Z and he wrote the whole fucking song.\"\n",

It features several cameos: Eminem chasing a group of women across a beach, Xzibit driving a lowrider, Funkmaster Flex with Dr. Dre, and Warren G riding with several women.

      "    WikiContent: \"Cool Kids\" is the debut single song by American indie pop band Echosmith from their 2013 debut studio album \"Talking Dreams\". The song was written by Echosmith, Jeffery David, and Jesiah Dzwonek. It was produced by Mike Elizondo, with additional production on the radio edit by Rob Cavallo. \"Cool Kids\" was originally released on May 31, 2013, as the iTunes Store Single of the Week and officially impacted United States radio the following year. The song subsequently became a sleeper hit, peaking at number 13 on the Billboard Hot 100 and receiving airplay on US modern rock, hot adult contemporary, and contemporary hit radio stations.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is the first single not only for the album but for the band itself. The song went Platinum in December 2014. Crazy part is that the song was nearly left off of their album.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jamie (singer/guitarist) says the message of the song is simple: the coolest thing you can be is yourself. But more often than not, fans tell the band that they relate to the kids they’re singing about. That they feel like the outsider looking in.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This cry to be like the cool kids… it’s something that everyone kind of goes through whether you want to act like it or not. There’s always somebody out there that you kind of wish, ‘If only I could do this, or do that.’ I think that’s why it connects with people so well.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He also said to NGEN radio:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I think \"Cool Kids\" is definitely a song that people have been connecting with a lot, and I think the song for us is a story about a boy and a girl who want to fit in and they see these kids they think are so cool. In reality the message is if being being yourself is cool, then you don’t have to try to be someone else.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "When asked about the powerful lyrics, Sydney (lead vocalist) explained:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We didn’t write the song with the intent of, ‘Oh my gosh, I want to write a hit single, and I want people to know our song.’ Obviously you do want that, but when you write, you need to be honest; we wrote this song because we relate to it. Everybody at some point, whether you’re a kid or not, you do have that desire to be like somebody else, and you constantly compare yourself. And it’s an everyday decision to decide not to.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "With a cool little story to follow about Katy Perry loving the song too.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I was backstage and she was just walking to her green room and she said, “cool kids, I wish I could be like them” and, like, pointed at me and walked away.

The lyrics depict the lead singer and their friends engaging in reckless behavior, embracing the thrill of the moment, and temporarily escaping their responsibilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "The chorus sets the scene as the protagonist enters a dirty room tainted with the smell of cigarettes, acknowledging that the events of the night may be easily forgotten. The lines \"So I'ma shoot that ball with my eyes closed\" symbolize taking risks without fear or hesitation, displaying a sense of confidence. By doing so, they ensure that everyone in the room is aware of their presence and uninhibited nature.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the first verse, the focus shifts to the lead singer's romantic relationships and their pursuit of pleasure. They convey a carefree attitude, unencumbered by the consequences of their actions. The lyrics also mention the influence of the music industry, with labels calling the artist. This could represent the pressures and demands of the industry, which the lead singer and their \"brothers\" (likely referring to their close friends or collaborators) navigate while still reveling in the party atmosphere.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second verse highlights the pursuit of wealth and fame, with the lead singer emphasizing their ambitions and success. They mention the energy of their live performances and the impact they have on the audience. The lyrics reflect the \"wild\" reputation they have earned, emphasizing that they enjoy the attention and excitement that comes with it.\n",

      "    WikiContent: \"Space Song\" is a song of reassurance and connection - a reminder that there is hope to be found in even the darkest moments and that love and support can be found to bring you back to a sense of peace, comfort and unity. Despite the pain and uncertainty of life, the song recognizes the importance of companionship and of finding a space, physically or metaphorically, to support one another. The chorus \"Fall back into place\" is a call to not give up, but to search for connection, understanding and solace even in uncertain times.\n",

      "(2/2/20): What was the recording process behind the track like? “We sped it up when we tracked the vocals, so that the vocals sound a bit pitched down.” ~ Reddit\n",
      "(9/24/21): “That song was started on a simple chord progression and with the riff, that was the genesis of the song which is just the melody that starts the song, and then all the other parts grew out of that. It came to that title, Space Song, on its own accord. That song is addressing ‘where do you sit in the order of existence, where do you sit,’ and from the minutia of a romance to the questions of existence. It’s funny how they’re such a similar question when you think about it.” ~ Alex, KINK-FM\n",
      "(9/24/21): “Within the song, there’s emotions. If you look at the lyrics, there’s clear and simple little symbols. There’s heartbreak, there’s sorrow, there’s a want to escape; there’s so many things inside of it, we believe. Calling it Space Song, sometimes we find titles and they just fit. Some of my earliest, fondest memories of that song were playing it live, it always felt like it had this thing in it, like you were disappearing into the ether. Alex said it’s abstract, but it’s not abstract with nothing inside of it. There’s a lot of little pieces and you make what you want from that.” ~ Victoria, KINK-FM.\n",
      "(2/16/22): “It’s like this comet that’s doing its own thing, that’s super fun and ridiculous. It’s also beyond our ability to control or understand, and that is relaxing to me. I am definitely a child of chaos, and something that calms me is understanding that there’s beauty in chaos, but you have to let go. I have never tried to understand ‘Space Song’ and I don’t want to. You respect it and you leave it alone. I don’t need to analyze it because I’m grateful for it. I don’t think it’s just that song, but if that is the gateway, then I’m happy about it. We both feel lucky that younger people keep discovering us and we’re able to keep making records.” ~ Victoria, Pitchfork <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Beach+House/_/Space+Song\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
